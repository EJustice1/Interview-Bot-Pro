# terraform/api_gateway.tf

# Placeholder for API Gateway resources.
# We will define these more fully when the user_auth_service is ready to be invoked.

# Example (to be expanded):
# resource "google_api_gateway_api" "user_api" {
#   provider = google-beta # API Gateway often requires the beta provider
#   project  = var.gcp_project_id
#   api_id   = "user-services-api"
# }

# output "api_gateway_user_api_name" {
#   description = "Name of the User API in API Gateway."
#   value       = google_api_gateway_api.user_api.name
# }
